# Node.js Backend Service

## Technical Overview

This Node.js backend service is a testament to my skills as a developer, showcasing my proficiency in building backend applications with Node.js. The service includes routes for managing products, connecting to a MongoDB database, error handling, and middleware setup. Please note that this service is intended for technical demonstration and is not meant for production use.

## Features

### Clean Code Structure

- Utilizes a well-organized code structure for maintainability and readability.

### Express.js Server

- Uses Express.js as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and routing.

### MongoDB Database

- Connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.

### API Routes

- Defines API routes for managing products, including fetching products with various query parameters.

### Error Handling Middleware

- Implements error handling middleware to gracefully handle and log errors, ensuring robust service operation.

## Project Structure

- **`app.js`**: The main application file that sets up the Express.js server, routes, and middleware.

- **`routes/products.js`**: Defines API routes for product management, including fetching products with different filters.

- **`db/connect.js`**: Connects to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

- **`middleware/error-handler.js`**: Error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors.

- **`middleware/not-found.js`**: Middleware for handling routes that do not exist.

- **`models/product.js`**: Defines the MongoDB schema for the 'Product' collection.
